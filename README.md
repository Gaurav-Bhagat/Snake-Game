🐍 Snake Game (Qt C++)

Overview:
A classic Snake Game developed using Qt (C++ GUI framework), inspired by the traditional mobile snake game. The game features smooth graphics, boundary collision detection, and enhanced gameplay with obstacles and teleportation.

Features:

    ✅ Snake dies upon hitting the boundary (just like the original game).

    🍎 Food spawns at random intervals and locations — eating it increases the snake's length and score.

    🪨 Rocks appear on the field and must be avoided; colliding with a rock ends the game.

    🌀 Two teleportation caves are placed at the top-left and bottom-right corners of the field — entering one instantly teleports the snake to the other.

    🎮 Intuitive keyboard controls and responsive gameplay.

    🎨 Grid-based visual representation using Qt's painting and event system.
